Remember, it's okay to ask for help.\n\nFirst, let's focus on keeping yourself safe. If you feel like you might hurt yourself, please call a helpline immediately. In the US, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). If you're outside the US, you can find a helpline in your country [here](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/).\n\nNow, let's focus on finding ways to cope. Here are some small, achievable steps you can take:\n\n1. **Deep Breathing:** Take a deep breath in for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat this 5 times. This can help calm your mind and body.\n\n2. **Positive Self-Talk:** Tell yourself, \"I am strong. I can get through this. I deserve to feel better.\"\n\n3. **Connect with a Friend:** Reach out to a trusted friend or family member. Sometimes, just talking about how you're feeling can help.\n\n4. **Write Down Your Feelings:** Write a letter to someone you trust about how you're feeling. You don't have to send it if you don't want to. Just the act of writing can help you process your emotions.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Help:** If you're struggling to cope, it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies and support to help you feel better.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Take one step at a time, and remember that things can get better. You are strong, and you can get through this.",
